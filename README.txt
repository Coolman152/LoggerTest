Logger v0.0.1 — CONSISTENT PACK (Fixes genInterior error)

This pack keeps index.html, style.css, and main.js from the SAME working build
to avoid missing-function errors like:
  ReferenceError: genInterior is not defined

Changes:
- Project title set to Logger v0.0.1
- Three.js CDN switched to jsDelivr (works on your network)
- favicon 404 prevented
- Save keys renamed to logger_save_0_0_1

Upload these 3 files to your GitHub repo root:
- index.html
- style.css
- main.js
